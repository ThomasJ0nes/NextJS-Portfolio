In the app, users can search scientific articles using DOI and make anonymous comments on them. We integrated web3 wallet login and delved into zkEMAIL sowftware for email verification. When the user wants to verify an institutional email, the app will generate a random word that the user needs to autoemail themselves using the institutional email, the user then uploads the email signature with the random word included in it.",

    description2:
      "I was responsible for the front end, and most of the backend as well as the web 3 wallet login that we used to verify the users. I built this using NextJs14, typescript, tailwind and deployed live using Vercel. We used a modern tailwindcss library, NextUI for a smoother and more visually appealing UX. For storing papers adding comments to papers etc we used a postgres sql database connected via vercel to store any data we needed like papers and comments. We then connected to the database from our front end via api calls in typescript to the database. ",
    description3:
      "For logging users in so we could differentiate users while still trying to keep them anonymous and not collect any data that could identity them we decided to use sign in with ethereum. For this we used Dynamic.xyz library along with ethers.js which allowed us to implement users to sign up with their eth wallet address. Once a user signed up we stored their wallet address in our db, allowing us to have a anonymous login and remember users, enabling us to see which accounts were verifed via zk email and which we not.
