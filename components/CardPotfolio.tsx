          of four. Hackathon project i was apart of where we won second place
          for the vault category. I was responsible for the UI and the front end
          of the project. NextJS - I used NextJS 14 to build the site, Nextjs
          helped me build the UI at speed, as the hackathon was only 2 weeks
          long. I used NextJS for the routing, the server side rendering and the
          static site generation. I also used NextJS for the API routes to
          interact with the smart contracts. Vercel - I used Vercel to quickly
          and easily deploy the front end for a live demo. It works nicely with
          NextJS build and deploys easily from a github repo. Tailwind CSS,
          ShadCN UI - I used Tailwind CSS to style the site, I used the ShadCN
          UI for reusable and lightweight components. Ethers.js - Family Wallet
          Connect Kit I used Ethers.js to interact with the smart contracts, I
          used the Family Wallet Connect Kit to connect to the users wallet and
          interact with the smart contracts.

          In the app, users can search scientific articles using DOI and make
          anonymous comments on them. We integrated web3 wallet login and delved
          into zkEMAIL sowftware for email verification. When the user wants to
          verify an institutional email, the app will generate a random word
          that the user needs to autoemail themselves using the institutional
          email, the user then uploads the email signature with the random word
          included in it. I was responsible for the front end, and most of the
          backend as well as the web 3 wallet login that we used to verify the
          users. I built this using NextJs14, typescript, tailwind and deployed
          live using Vercel. We used a modern tailwindcss library, NextUI for a
          smoother and more visually appealing UX. For storing papers adding
          comments to papers etc we used a postgres sql database connected via
          vercel to store any data we needed like papers and comments. We then
          connected to the database from our front end via api calls in
          typescript to the database.
          <br></br>
          For logging users in so we could differentiate users while still
          trying to keep them anonymous and not collect any data that could
          identity them we decided to use sign in with ethereum. For this we
          used Dynamic.xyz library along with ethers.js which allowed us to
          implement users to sign up with their eth wallet address. Once a user
          signed up we stored their wallet address in our db, allowing us to
          have a anonymous login and remember users, enabling us to see which
          accounts were verifed via zk email and which we not.

        <p>
          I recently developed a cutting-edge web development agency site using
          NextJS 14 and Tailwind CSS. My focus was on creating a modern and
          clean aesthetic, ensuring an intuitive user experience. I incorporated
          subtle animations and smooth transitions to enhance the site&apos;s
          interactivity without overwhelming the user. The combination of
          NextJS&apos;s powerful framework and Tailwind&apos;s utility-first
          approach allowed me to efficiently build a highly responsive and
          visually appealing website.
          <br />
          In addition to the main site, I implemented a blog page using MDX
          (Markdown with JSX). This approach allowed me to seamlessly integrate
          React components within markdown content, providing a versatile and
          dynamic way to present blog posts. The MDX blog page is designed to be
          both user-friendly and developer-friendly, enabling easy content
          updates and rich interactivity.
